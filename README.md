Note
When clicked on the Podcast category on the Podcast Home Page, it must display the respective person podcasts page and when the back button is clicked Podcast Home Page must be displayed.
Try to achieve the design as close as possible.

Important Note
Warning
The CCBP UI kit works only if the value of the HTML id attribute of the container section has the prefix as section. So, the id which we specify for any section should always contain its prefix as section if you are using CCBP UI Kit.

Sections must be parallel and not nested within each other.

HTML
<div id="sectionHomePage">...</div>
<div id="sectionConferencePage">...</div>

Avoid assigning Bootstrap flex properties directly to a section container.

Example
Wrong usage:
HTML
<div id="sectionHomepage" class="d-flex">
  ...
</div>
